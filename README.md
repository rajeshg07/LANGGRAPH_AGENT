**LangGraph Agent**
A modular AI agent built with LangGraph to handle user queries, generate hashtags, analyze trends, and provide general responses using a FastAPI backend and Gradio interface.
Overview
This project leverages LangGraph, a framework for building stateful, multi-agent systems, to create an AI agent that processes user queries. The agent uses an LLM (via OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini) for intent detection and response generation, with optional SerpApi integration for real-time data. Key features include:

Intent Detection: Classifies queries into "hashtags", "trends", or "general" using an LLM.
Hashtag Generation: Generates trending hashtags for platforms like Instagram or TikTok using SerpApi or the LLM.
Trend Analysis: Fetches current social media trends via SerpApi or generates them with the LLM.
General Responses: Provides answers to general queries using the LLM.
Response Validation: Ensures response quality with retry logic.
Logging: Comprehensive logging to both console and file (logs/app.log) for debugging and tracking.

The project uses a FastAPI backend for API endpoints, a Gradio interface for user interaction, and modular node-based architecture for extensibility.

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.8+
uv (for dependency management, or use pip if preferred)
OpenAI API key (for LLM usage)
SerpApi API key (optional, for real-time hashtag/trend data)

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd langgraph_example


Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:Using uv:
uv sync

Or using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure you have requirements.txt with:
fastapi
uvicorn
gradio
httpx
python-dotenv
openai
serpapi
langgraph


Set Up Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the project root:
touch .env

Add your API keys:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your-serpapi-api-key



Usage

Run the FastAPI Backend:Start the FastAPI server to handle queries:
uv run main.py

The server will run on http://0.0.0.0:8000.

Run the Gradio Interface:In a separate terminal, launch the Gradio UI:
uv run python app.py

Access the interface at http://0.0.0.0:7860.

Interact with the Agent:

Open the Gradio interface in your browser.
Enter queries like:
"provide some hashtags for my Instagram reel"
"show me the latest trends"
"what is digital marketing?"


View responses, generated hashtags, trends, logs, and conversation history.


Check Logs:Logs are written to logs/app.log and displayed in the console for debugging:
03:38 PM +0545 - INFO - Detecting intent for query: provide hashtags for instagram
03:38 PM +0545 - INFO - Intent detected by LLM: hashtags



**Project Workflow**

Query Input: User submits a query via the Gradio interface.
Intent Detection: The intent_detector node uses an LLM to classify the intent (hashtags, trends, or general).
Node Execution:
hashtags: hashtag_generator fetches or generates hashtags using SerpApi or LLM.
trends: trend_analyzer fetches or generates trends.
general: llm_handler provides a direct LLM response.


Validation: response_validator ensures the response quality, retrying up to 3 times if needed.
Output: The response is displayed in the Gradio UI, with logs updated.

Logging

Logs are stored in logs/app.log and printed to the console.
